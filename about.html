			<h1>So you want to know about a girl named Jordynn Beedle?</h1>
				<p>Well, you've come to the right place! As you probably have figured out by now, my name is Jordynn Beedle. I was born and raised under the bright, hot, Arizona sun and I've lived here for most of my life. Currently, I'm a sophomore at Arizona State University pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science. On top of being fascinated by all things CS, I'm also incredibly interested in music and the arts. I'm incredibly good at running into furniture and my favorite food is a potato.</p>
